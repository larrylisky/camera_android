Android camera app from scratch

Open project with Android Studio, build and run.

If you are emulating camera using your webcam, I find the emulator will crash if launched from the Android Studio.
When I launch the emulator first from command line, webcam works fine:

    $ emuator -avd <Your emulator name>
